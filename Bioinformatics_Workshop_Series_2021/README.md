# CVRC Bioinformatics Workshop Series 2021

## Basic Programming and Bioinformatics Analyses using R in Rstudio


<br>  

"R programming basics: Data structures, objects, and classes. How to make sense of data storage and manipulation."  
Presenter: Michael Gildea, PhD  

An introduction and practical guide to understanding the fundamentals of data storage and manipulation in R. This is meant to provide new(ish) users with a basic understanding of how R is structured by introducing data types/structures and the principle of objects and classes. This will give users the ability to make informed decisions on how to store, access, parse, and manipulate their data. Additionally, this will provide the knowledge necessary to quickly learn and utilize new packages and analyses in R.  

Pre-requisites: If you havenâ€™t already, make sure you go over the [Day 1 session](https://github.com/florschlamp/CVRC_NYU_Langone/tree/master/Bioinformatics_Workshop_Series_2020/Day_1) from the [Fall 2020 workshop series](https://github.com/florschlamp/CVRC_NYU_Langone/tree/master/Bioinformatics_Workshop_Series_2020). The code used can be found [here](https://github.com/florschlamp/CVRC_NYU_Langone/blob/master/Bioinformatics_Workshop_Series_2020/Day_1/Day1_code_post-session.R). For those who have never used R or R studio before we strongly recommend following the video recording of the workshop, which can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7FM7NvMqfE).
