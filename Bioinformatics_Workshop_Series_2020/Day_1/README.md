# Day 1 - Introduction: First Steps on using R in Rstudio
## Friday, September 25th, 2020

The only requirement to join this session is to have both R and RStudio installed on your computer or laptop (instructions below).  

This first session is required for all beginner users to be able to follow along future sessions. Intermediate users are encouraged to use this as a general review and refresher, especially those who havenâ€™t used R in a while or are new to RStudio.

### DOWNLOAD INSTRUCTIONS:

[<b>For Mac users</b>: if you do not already have XQuartz (also called X11 on older machines) installed on your laptop, you need to install it <b>before doing anything else</b>. You can find the installation package here: https://www.xquartz.org/]  

First, you will need to install R on your laptop. Note: you must do this <b>before</b> you install RStudio. The installation packages for R can be found here: https://cran.r-project.org/. For Mac users, you want to download the file called <b>R-4.0.2.pkg</b>. For Windows users, you want to click on the "<b>install R for the first time</b>" button, and then "Download R 4.0.2 for Windows".  
 
Once you have installed R, please also install RStudio. The download instructions are here: https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download. Choose either Mac or Windows.  

Once the installation is complete, open up RStudio to make sure the installation worked.

If you have any issues with the download, you can stop by my virtual office hours (listed below). If neither of those times work do not hesitate to email me \<Florencia.Schlamp@nyulangone.org> or Emily \<Emily.Brown2@nyulangone.org> so we can help you out.
