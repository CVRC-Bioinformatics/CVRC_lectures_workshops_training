Now that you have normalized counts, log Fold Changes, and p-values for all genes, you will learn to plot your data using multiple types of plots, such as volcano plots, MA plots, and heatmaps. More specifically, in this session you will learn how to customize these plots in ggplot and pheatmap R packages based on your needs, and we will also introduce a few other helpful R packages for more advanced customization. Examples of plot modifications that you will be able to do by the end of this session include: how to color code significantly up- and down-regulated genes, how to label the name of certain genes of interest, how to make an interactive volcano plot, how to add or remove legends, how to subset data for heatmaps, how to label heatmap columns based on specific groups (such as treatment vs control, or cell types), and how to make scaled heatmaps.

### Installing ggplot2: 
install.packages("ggplot2")

# if the installation worked, you should be able to run the following line without error messages:
library(ggplot2)
```
