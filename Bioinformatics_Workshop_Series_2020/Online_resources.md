There are tons of online resources available for R.  Often, a quick google search can lead you to forums like BioStars, where you can find answers to common problems.  However, there are also many resources available online that can serve as good references.

The first worth mentioning is the cheat sheets available via RStudio

Scroll down for available cheat sheets; the ggplot2 cheat sheat is particularly helpful.

Another, more comprehensive resource, is the online book "R For Data Science".  This includes lots of tricks for how to re-format your data to make plotting easier.
