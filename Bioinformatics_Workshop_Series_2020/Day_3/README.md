In this session we will focus on plotting the data that we cleaned up and normalized in the previous session ([Part 1, Data Manipulation](https://github.com/florschlamp/CVRC_NYU_Langone/tree/master/Bioinformatics_Workshop_Series_2020/Day_2)). You will learn to use R to do pairwise scatterplots to compare replicates and samples. You will learn the basics of the pheatmap R package to make heatmaps of the similarity between samples, and we will introduce the basics of ggplot R package to plot individual genes of interest. These include dot plots to represent gene expression per sample and per group, barplots, and boxplots. You will also learn how to plot multiple genes at the same time or genes in paired data and time series.
